"""Shared fixtures for the ai_rossbypalooza recipe tests.

The recipe modules live under ``examples/weather/ai_rossbypalooza/`` (examples
don't ship as an installable package), so that directory is inserted on
``sys.path`` here once for all test modules. Synthetic tiny-grid zarr fixtures
for both hindcast schemas, IMERG truth, and normalization stats are added in
this file as the datapipe tests grow.
