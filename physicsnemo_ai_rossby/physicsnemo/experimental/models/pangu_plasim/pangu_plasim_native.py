r"""Native PhysicsNeMo variants of the Pangu_Plasim emulators.

After Phase 6 Track A the faithful Pangu_Plasim classes are themselves
backed by upstream :mod:`physicsnemo.nn` blocks. The *native* classes in
this module are thin subclasses that differ from the faithful pair only
in their :class:`ModelMetaData`:

* :class:`PanguPlasimLegacyNative` — same architecture, same forward, same
  state-dict layout as :class:`PanguPlasimLegacy`, but advertises
  ``cuda_graphs=True`` + ``auto_grad=True`` so the model can be wrapped in
  :class:`physicsnemo.utils.capture.StaticCaptureTraining` with no Module
  introspection complaining about an unsupported optimization path.
* :class:`PanguPlasimNative` — same relationship to :class:`PanguPlasim`
  (the VAE variant).

Trainer / inference code routes to these via the standard
``cfg.model.name`` switch; the native variants are intended for *fresh*
training runs that exercise the AMP + CUDA-graph fast path. The
:mod:`tools.checkpoint_translation.pangu_plasim` translator continues to
target the faithful classes only — translation into native variants is
not supported because the design intent is to evolve the native
architectures independently of the PanguWeather .tar contract.

CUDA-graph caveat
-----------------
The faithful classes' forward includes activation checkpointing
controlled by the ``checkpointing`` constructor kwarg. CUDA graphs are
incompatible with ``torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint``, so users must
set ``checkpointing=0`` (the default) when wrapping a native variant in
``StaticCaptureTraining`` with CUDA graphs enabled. AMP without CUDA
graphs is unaffected.

    Signature note
    --------------
    Uses **kwargs-only forwarding** rather than ``*args, **kwargs``. The
    parent :class:`physicsnemo.Module` introspects ``inspect.signature``
    at construction to persist constructor args for checkpoint
    round-trip — a ``*args`` parameter named ``args`` would be saved as
    the literal kwarg ``args=...`` and break the load path. All callers
    (Module.instantiate, build_model, tests) pass kwargs, so this is no
    practical restriction.
