"""Pangu_Plasim weather emulators ported from PanguWeather v2.0.

Two architectures, each in a faithful (weight-compatible) and a
native (PhysicsNeMo upstream + StaticCapture-friendly) flavor:

* :class:`PanguPlasim` — current model with the training-only VAE dual-encoder.
* :class:`PanguPlasimLegacy` — predecessor model without the VAE.
* :class:`PanguPlasimNative` / :class:`PanguPlasimLegacyNative` — same
  architectures, registered with CUDA-graph-friendly :class:`ModelMetaData`
  for fresh training runs.
