# MoWE Method 0 — data loader, model, losses, and how to run it

Mixture-of-AI-Weather-Experts gate for week-2 Indian monsoon rainfall. A ViT
(DiT) gate learns per-gridpoint weights and bias corrections that blend the
daily precipitation forecasts of four **frozen** AIWP experts into one field,
scored against IMERG over the IMD gauge region. Experts are never fine-tuned —
that is Method 1.

Data provenance and the harmonised store schema live in [DATA.md](DATA.md);
measured results and the reasoning behind the loss choices are in
[`docs/dev/context/mowe-loss-formulation-findings.md`](../../../docs/dev/context/mowe-loss-formulation-findings.md).

---

## 1. Data loader

`datapipes/` — one sample is one **(initialization, lead-day τ)** pair.

**Sources.** Four harmonised expert archives at 1° on IMERG's grid
(180×360, lat 89.5→−89.5 N→S), `hindcasts_mowe/{model}/{YYYY}.zarr` with dims
`(init_time, lead_time[days, 0=IC], lat, lon)`: `pangu_s2s`, `sfno_era5`,
`graphcast` (merged e2s+wb2), `aifs_single_v2`. Truth is IMERG
`total_precipitation_24hr` in mm/day.

**Sample construction** (`index.py`). The initialization universe is the
**union** across experts, not the intersection, so an init present in only some
archives is still usable. For each (init, τ) a per-expert bit records whether
that expert has the init *and* supports the lead; pairs with fewer than
`min_experts` live experts are dropped at build time, so there is no runtime
skipping and every DDP rank derives an identical index from coordinates alone.

**Day alignment.** A sample covers `[init+(τ−1)·24h, init+τ·24h)`, and the IMERG
record is stamped `date(init)+(τ−1)`. Per-expert `precip.day_offset` corrects
models whose precip is offset — **sfno needs `day_offset: 1`** because its precip
head is forward-looking (verified by correlation against IMERG).

**Channels** (`variables.py`). Every native name from either raw schema is
normalised to a canonical `(variable, level_hPa)` key *before* any channel
lookup, so the same physical field from different models always lands in the same
slot and receives the same normalisation. **Channel 0 is always precip**;
`master_channels` in the dataset config lists the dynamical predictors
(currently z500, z850, q850, u850, v850, u250, msl, sp).

**Normalisation** (`stats.py`). Dynamical channels use ERA5 stats matched by
level *value* (raising rather than silently mismatching). Precip uses shared
IMERG statistics computed in the **log-transformed** space:
`log(1e-3 + P[m/24h])`, mean −6.379, std 0.858. The transform is read from the
stats store's own attributes, so a transform/stats mismatch is impossible.

**Missing experts** are handled at three levels: dropped at index build if the
init or lead is absent; demoted at read time if the finite fraction < 0.5 or the
precip channel is all-NaN; and in the model the mask becomes E extra input
planes plus a `-inf` softmax fill, so a masked expert gets **exactly zero**
weight. `expert_dropout` (0.30) randomly drops live experts during training, so
one checkpoint serves any expert subset. Missing ≡ 0 in z-space, which is *not*
0 mm/day once inverted (≈0.70), hence `mix()` also takes the mask as a guard.

**Sample dict:** `expert_inputs (E,1+C,180,360)`, `expert_mask (E,)`,
`target (1,180,360)` normalised, `target_mm (1,180,360)` physical, plus
`lead_days`, `init_time`, `valid_time`, `pair_idx`.

**Windows.** Training leads **7–14**, validation **8–14** (week 2). Day 15 is
unusable: sfno's `day_offset` means τ=15 needs lead 16 and the harmonised stores
stop at 15. graphcast carries `min_lead_day: 8` because its wb2-sourced inits
have no complete 24 h precip window at 168 h.

---

## 2. Model

`mowe_precip.py` — `MoWEPrecipGate(DiT)`, **3.81M parameters**
(`hidden_size 192`, `depth 4`, `num_heads 6`, `patch_size 4×4` → 4050 tokens;
`drop_path 0.15`).

Input `(B, E, 1+C, H, W)` is folded to `E·(1+C) + E` channels — every expert
block plus E constant mask planes, so the gate is *told* which experts are
absent. Output is `2E` channels split into logits and biases:

```
weights = softmax( logits.masked_fill(mask == 0, -inf) )   # over experts
P̂       = Σᵢ wᵢ · (Pᵢ + bᵢ)                                 # mix(), outside the model
```

Lead time τ enters through DiT's conditioning path. Mixing lives **outside** the
model so validation can log the weight maps. `model.mix_space` controls the space
the combination happens in and **must stay `physical`**: combining standardized
log channels makes the ensemble a weighted *geometric* mean (2 and 50 mm/day →
11.4 instead of 26.0, a 2.3× compression, and a −3.5 mm/day July bias). `log` is
retained only as an ablation.

Capacity note: the earlier 384/8 gate (24.0M params) overfit badly against only
~2,900 independent initializations — validation loss bottomed at epoch 10 then
rose 18% while training loss fell 54%.

---

## 3. The two losses that worked

Both take the error over the **training region** (monsoon box 5–35°N/60–100°E ∩
IMD gauge coverage = 378 gridpoints, cos-lat weighted) and both mix in mm/day.
`scale_mm: 9.3` divides the physical MSE so it lands near 1.0 and the tuned
learning rate and gradient clipping carry over — pure rescaling, the optimum is
unchanged.

### `loss=regional_mse_physical` — best aggregate skill

```yaml
name: regional_mse   # space: physical, scale_mm: 9.3
```

Squared error in mm/day, so it elicits the conditional **mean** and is unbiased
by construction. **Best RMSE and ACC of anything tested**, but it wins them by
hedging intensity: amplitude ratio 0.392 against ACC 0.337, i.e. essentially the
MSE-optimal shrinkage σ_p = r·σ_t. It produces **4.8% of observed 50 mm/day
events** and its CSI at 20 mm is *below equal-weight's*.

### `loss=regional_mse_physical_var` — recommended

```yaml
name: regional_mse   # space: physical, scale_mm: 9.3, var_weight: 1.0
```

Adds `var_weight · (σ_pred/σ_obs − 1)²` on the region-weighted **spatial**
standard deviation per sample, forbidding the hedging. It is the only arm that
beats equal-weight on RMSE *and* heavy-rain frequency *and* CSI simultaneously,
and it posts the best gate SEEPS (0.839, effectively tying AIFS at 0.836).
`var_weight` 3.0 overshoots — it breaks the equal-weight RMSE floor and collapses
ACC — so 1.0 is bracketed as the sweet spot.

| Loss | RMSE | bias | ACC | amp | SEEPS | exc_bias 20mm | CSI 20mm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `regional_mse_physical` | **8.96** | −0.18 | **0.337** | 0.392 | 0.853 | 0.400 | 0.164 |
| `regional_mse_physical_var` | 9.13 | −0.16 | 0.313 | 0.477 | **0.839** | 0.611 | **0.196** |
| equal_weight (bar) | 9.43 | −0.02 | 0.272 | 0.537 | 0.871 | 0.588 | 0.173 |
| aifs_single_v2 (bar) | 9.91 | 0.41 | 0.310 | 0.755 | 0.836 | 0.859 | 0.211 |

### Cross-validated (5 folds, 20 train / 5 held-out years each)

Means over folds validating 2000-04, 2005-09, 2010-14, 2015-19 and 2020-24, each
with its normalisation and climatology refitted on that fold's training years:

| CV mean | RMSE | bias | ACC | amp | SEEPS | exc_bias 20mm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `regional_mse_physical` | **8.556** | −0.03 | **0.350** | 0.402 | 0.827 | 0.431 |
| `regional_mse_physical_var` | 8.752 | +0.01 | 0.317 | 0.486 | **0.799** | **0.646** |
| equal_weight (bar) | 8.963 | +0.04 | 0.292 | 0.539 | 0.833 | 0.598 |
| aifs_single_v2 (bar) | 9.596 | +0.45 | 0.296 | 0.761 | 0.789 | 0.864 |

Both gate variants beat **both** bars on RMSE and on ACC in **all five folds**,
so the single-split advantage is not a favourable window. Per-fold RMSE spans
8.27–8.96 for physical MSE; fold 5 (2020-24) is the hardest period for every
source, which means the original single split was the pessimistic choice.

The trade-off is unchanged out of sample and is the reason both losses are kept:
physical MSE takes RMSE and ACC, but its heavy-rain frequency (0.431) is far
*below* equal-weight's 0.598, whereas the variance-matched version exceeds it at
0.646 — 5/5 folds each way — and posts the better SEEPS (0.799 vs 0.827, beating
equal-weight in 5/5 folds and approaching AIFS's 0.789). Bias is small for both
across every fold, so the dry-bias problem is resolved.

**Pick `regional_mse_physical_var` for the project's stated criterion** (skill at
moderate-to-heavy intensities); pick `regional_mse_physical` only if aggregate
RMSE/ACC is the target.

Also available: `regional_mse` (log space, `space: normalized`),
`regional_mse_bias` (log space + `bias_weight`), `regional_log_mse`. Both
log-space arms were clearly worse (RMSE 9.37–9.44, ACC ≈0.29). **MAE would not
help**: absolute error elicits the median (3.65 mm/day against an arithmetic mean
of 9.32 on IMERG July), and the median is invariant under monotone transforms.

**Loss values are not comparable across these configs** — different objectives.
Compare the metrics.

## 4. Train

Per-cluster wrappers, one GPU node each:

```bash
# Midway3, 4x H100 on the dedicated pedramh-gpu node
sbatch --export=ALL,RUN_NAME=mowe_prod,WANDB=true,\
EXTRA="loss=regional_mse_physical_var" tools/train_mowe_midway3_h100.sbatch

# Derecho, 4x A100
qsub -v RUN_NAME=mowe_prod,WANDB=true,EXTRA_FILE=/path/overrides.txt \
     tools/train_mowe_derecho.pbs
```

**Overrides containing commas must go through `EXTRA_FILE`.** Both Slurm's
`--export` and PBS's `-v` are comma-separated lists, so
`dataset.train.years=[2000,2024]` is silently truncated and Hydra then fails with
`no viable alternative at input`.

Defaults (`conf/training/default.yaml`): AdamW lr 3e-4 with 2-epoch warmup and
cosine decay, `max_epochs 40`, bf16, grad-clip 1.0, weight decay 0.15,
`expert_dropout 0.30`, EMA (decay 0.999, validation and best-checkpoint use EMA
weights), early stopping on the validation loss with patience 8.

Checkpoints land in `<rundir>/outputs/<run_name>/`:
* `checkpoints/` — every 5 epochs plus the final epoch, for resuming. **The final
  epoch is the most overfit; do not ship it.**
* `checkpoints_best/` — best validation loss. **Use this one.**

Resume by re-submitting with the same `RUN_NAME`.

---

## 5. Validate

Validation runs inside training every epoch and reports, for the gate, the
equal-weight ensemble, and each expert separately, all over the 378-gridpoint
training region in mm/day:

* per lead 8–14 and a mean: `rmse_lead{τ}`, `bias_lead{τ}`, `seeps_lead{τ}`
* per calendar month pooled over validation years:
  `imd_{rmse,bias,acc,seeps,amp}_{MM}` and `_mean`
* intensity-resolved at 1/5/10/20/50 mm/day: `exc_bias_{T}mm` (frequency bias
  P(pred>T)/P(obs>T)) and `csi_{T}mm`
* `loss` — the training criterion on the validation split, pairing with
  `train/loss`; plus `{source}/loss` per baseline

Two definitions to keep straight. **ACC uses a day-of-year climatology**
(`clim_mean_daily`, ±7-day smoothed) — a monthly reference leaves the monsoon
onset in both forecast and observed anomalies and inflates the correlation
(central India runs 3.06 → 8.02 mm/day within June alone). And **`amp` =
σ_pred/σ_obs** is the shrinkage diagnostic: ≈1 preserves intensity, ≈ACC means
the loss is hedging.

To re-validate a checkpoint without training, run inference (below) and score the
saved forecasts, or re-submit training with `training.max_epochs` equal to the
resumed epoch.

### Best checkpoints

Single-split runs (train 2000–2019, validate 2020–2024 Mar–Sep), on Midway3:

| Loss | Path (`/scratch/midway3/awikner/mowe_runs/outputs/…`) | Best epoch |
|---|---|---|
| `regional_mse_physical_var` (recommended) | `mowe_v6_var1/checkpoints_best/` | 29 |
| `regional_mse_physical` | `mowe_v6_physmse_ref/checkpoints_best/` | 12 |

5-fold cross-validation (20 train / 5 held-out years per fold, per-fold refitted
normalisation and climatology) on Derecho:

```
/glade/derecho/scratch/awikner/mowe_runs/outputs/mowe_cv{1..5}_phys/checkpoints_best/
/glade/derecho/scratch/awikner/mowe_runs/outputs/mowe_cv{1..5}_physvar/checkpoints_best/
```

Fold *k* holds out: 1 → 2000-04, 2 → 2005-09, 3 → 2010-14, 4 → 2015-19,
5 → 2020-24. Each contains `MoWEPrecipGate.0.<epoch>.mdlus` and
`checkpoint.0.<epoch>.pt`; `load_checkpoint` picks the latest automatically.

Both verified to exist (2026-07-30). `checkpoints_best/` keeps every
best-so-far checkpoint rather than only the final one, so the highest epoch
number is the best; `load_checkpoint` selects it automatically.

---

## 6. Infer and save gate forecasts

`tools/infer_mowe.py` loads a checkpoint, replays a split deterministically
(single process — I/O bound, no DDP), and writes a dense zarr. Run it on a GPU
node (**Midway's H100 node for inference tests**), not a login node.

```bash
python tools/infer_mowe.py \
    dataset=hindcast_derecho \
    +checkpoint=/glade/derecho/scratch/awikner/mowe_runs/outputs/mowe_cv5_physvar/checkpoints_best \
    +out=/glade/derecho/scratch/awikner/mowe_forecasts/cv5_physvar.zarr \
    +split=val +save_gate=true
```

Output `(init_time, lead_time, lat, lon)`:

* `total_precipitation_24hr` — the mixture in **mm/day**.
* with `+save_gate=true`, additionally `(init_time, lead_time, expert, lat, lon)`:
  * `gate_weights` — masked-softmax weight per expert, summing to 1 over live
    experts and exactly 0 for a masked one. **These are the fields to inspect for
    the monsoon-structure question** (active/break phases, orographic vs.
    depression rainfall).
  * `gate_biases` — the learned per-expert additive correction, in the *mixing*
    space: mm/day under the default `mix_space=physical`, standardized-log
    offsets under `log`.

`P̂ = Σᵢ wᵢ(Pᵢ + bᵢ)`, so the two gate arrays plus the harmonised expert stores
reproduce the forecast exactly. Pairs absent from the index (IMERG gaps, too few
live experts) stay **NaN** — that is not a zero forecast. The gate arrays are E×
the forecast's size, hence off by default.

> **Only the supervised region is meaningful.** The gate emits fields at all
> 64,800 gridpoints but is trained on 378, and outside them the output is
> unconstrained extrapolation — measured on a real run, the biases average
> **−15.3 mm/day (1st percentile −82)** outside versus **−0.52 mm/day** inside.
> Plotting the global bias field would be badly misleading. The store records the
> region in its `supervised_region_box` / `supervised_region_note` attributes;
> mask with `region_mask(lat, lon, box) & imd_valid_mask(...)` before analysis.

Measured on the recommended checkpoint over the 2020–2024 Mar–Sep split
(3,255 pairs, 465 inits, ~45 min on one H100 — each pair is a separate zarr
region write, so buffer in memory if that becomes a bottleneck):

| | forecast precip | gate bias |
|---|---|---|
| inside the region | mean 5.56, median 2.45, p99 32.2 mm/day | mean −0.52, p99 +8.4 mm/day |
| outside (untrained) | mean 1.05, median 0.00 | mean −15.27, p1 −82.5 |

**Learned weights inside the region** (a first look at the monsoon-structure
question): graphcast **0.475**, aifs_single_v2 0.215, sfno_era5 0.184,
pangu_s2s 0.126. The gate concentrates on graphcast and downweights pangu, which
is also the weakest expert by ACC (0.104) — so it is discriminating on skill
rather than averaging blindly.

To score saved forecasts against IMERG, reuse the streaming accumulators in
`validation.py` (`StreamingRegionalScore`, `StreamingMonthlyScores`,
`StreamingThresholdScores`) with `region_weights(lat, lon, box,
extra_mask=imd_valid_mask(...))` so the region matches training exactly.

---

## 7. Week-2 accumulated precip (the primary target)

`tools/plot_week2_acc.py` scores the project's *primary* predictand rather than
the daily one the training metrics use: leads 8-14 are summed per init into a
week-2 total (mm/week) and compared against the same-week IMERG total, with
anomalies referenced to a **weekly** climatology built by summing the day-of-year
daily climatology over the same seven valid days. Each week is attributed to the
month of its midpoint (tau=11).

```bash
sbatch --export=ALL,CKPT=<checkpoints_best>,OUT=week2_acc.png \
       tools/plot_week2_acc_midway3.sbatch     # add +matched=true for a fair panel
```

**Use `+matched=true`.** The index takes the UNION of initializations, so without
it each source is scored on the weeks it happens to cover -- pangu/sfno reach
~280 of 465 weeks and aifs ~265, while the gate and equal-weight are defined for
all of them. That penalises the gate for covering the sparse weeks where only the
weak experts exist.

Matched sample (175 weeks with every source present, 2020-2024, gate =
`mowe_v6_var1`, trained 2000-2019 so the period is genuinely held out):

| ACC | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MoWE gate** | **0.478** | **0.579** | **0.472** | **0.457** | **0.582** | **0.598** | **0.563** | **0.512** | **0.530** |
| AIFS | 0.437 | 0.515 | 0.386 | 0.417 | 0.572 | 0.521 | 0.495 | 0.494 | 0.480 |
| Equal weight | 0.349 | 0.471 | 0.412 | 0.396 | 0.505 | 0.514 | 0.468 | 0.510 | 0.478 |
| GraphCast | 0.323 | 0.366 | 0.345 | 0.337 | 0.462 | 0.499 | 0.412 | 0.483 | 0.403 |
| SFNO-S2S | 0.099 | 0.159 | 0.149 | 0.223 | 0.335 | 0.375 | 0.268 | 0.308 | 0.239 |
| Pangu-S2S | 0.262 | 0.447 | 0.216 | 0.122 | 0.120 | 0.221 | 0.126 | −0.033 | 0.185 |

**The gate wins every month**, beating the best single expert by +0.050 ACC
(+10%) and equal-weight by +0.052 on the mean. Note weekly accumulation is
substantially more predictable than daily precip (ACC ~0.53 vs ~0.32), since
summing seven days averages out day-to-day timing error.

On the unmatched sample the gate averages 0.461 against AIFS's 0.485 — the
sample mismatch alone flips the headline, which is why the matched panel is the
one to quote. October rests on only 5 weeks and is noisy.

Figures use the Okabe-Ito palette (deuteranopia/protanopia safe, no
vermillion/green pairing) with the gate additionally hatched so it survives
greyscale printing.

## 8. Tests

```bash
pytest test/recipes/ai_rossbypalooza/ -m ""     # 166 tests; -m "" includes slow
```

Covers cross-schema channel identity, every precip unit/axis/offset combination,
conservative regridding, index union and gap handling, masked-softmax exactness,
the arithmetic-vs-geometric mixing distinction, the loss-ranking flip the
variance term is built to cause, EMA round-trips, early stopping, the day-of-year
ACC reference (a case where ACC flips sign against a monthly reference), the
intensity thresholds, and an end-to-end train→infer round trip.

## 9. Not yet built

* The plan's **primary** target is week-2 *accumulated* precip as tercile and
  exceedance probabilities; this trains and scores *daily* precip (the secondary
  target).
* The gate is deterministic (`noise_dim: null`), so BSS, RPSS, AUC, CRPS and rank
  histograms cannot be computed. A quantile/CRPS head is the natural next step.
* No FSS, no block-bootstrap significance.
* AIFS alone still beats every gate variant on July ACC (0.408 vs 0.355),
  amplitude, heavy-rain frequency, and CSI. A convex combination cannot exceed
  its inputs' amplitude, so the per-expert bias fields are the only lever with
  real headroom there.
