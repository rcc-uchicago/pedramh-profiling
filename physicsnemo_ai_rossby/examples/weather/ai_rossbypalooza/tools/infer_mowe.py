"""Run a trained MoWE gate and save its forecasts (and optionally its weights).

Loads a checkpoint, replays a split deterministically, and writes a dense
``(init_time, lead_time, lat, lon)`` zarr of the mixture's daily precip in
mm/day -- the artefact downstream analysis needs, which the training-time
validation does not produce (it only reduces to scalar metrics).

Single process on purpose: this is I/O bound and inference is cheap, so there is
no DDP to keep in lockstep and no risk of ranks disagreeing about the output
region.

Usage (dataset/region/split all come from the training config, so the forecasts
are guaranteed to line up with the metrics)::

    python tools/infer_mowe.py \\
        dataset=hindcast_derecho \\
        +checkpoint=/glade/derecho/scratch/awikner/mowe_runs/outputs/mowe_cv5_physvar/checkpoints_best \\
        +out=/glade/derecho/scratch/awikner/mowe_forecasts/cv5_physvar.zarr \\
        +split=val +save_weights=true

``+split`` is ``val`` (default) or ``train``. ``+save_gate=true`` additionally
writes the gate's own fields, each ``(init_time, lead_time, expert, lat, lon)``
and so E times the size of the forecast -- hence off by default:

* ``gate_weights`` -- masked-softmax weight per expert, summing to 1 over the
  live experts (exactly 0 for a masked one). These are what to inspect for the
  monsoon-structure question: which expert the gate trusts where and when.
* ``gate_biases`` -- the learned per-expert additive correction, in the MIXING
  space. With ``model.mix_space=physical`` (the default) that is mm/day, so the
  values are directly interpretable; with ``log`` they are offsets in
  standardized log space and are NOT mm/day.

The mixture is ``sum_i weights_i * (expert_precip_i + biases_i)``, so the two
arrays plus the harmonised expert stores reproduce the forecast exactly.

Missing (init, lead) pairs stay NaN, which is how a pair absent from the index
(an IMERG gap, or too few live experts) is represented; do not confuse that with
a zero forecast.
