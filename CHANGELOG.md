# CHANGELOG — pedramh-profiling living document

This is the **living document**: the shared memory across sessions. It records
what's done, what's in progress, what's blocked, measured results, and — most
importantly — **failed approaches so they aren't re-attempted**. Update it before
you stop working. Newest entries at the top of each section.

See **CLAUDE.md** for how to work here and **DESIGN.md** for what/why.

Format for entries: `YYYY-MM-DD — <what happened> — <result/measurement> — <what it means / next>`.

## Next actions (pick from the top)

1. **Polaris bring-up** — probe → 1-GPU → 4-GPU smoke for each model via PBS;
   write `polaris_pbs_notes.md`. Follow `polaris_handoff_prompt.md` (on `main`).
2. **Build the §4.0 prerequisites** — a `--seed` knob in `s2s/v2.0/train.py`, a
   `tiny_baseline.yaml`, and a VAE noise-fixing hook. Nothing can be optimized
   safely until the equivalence gate is executable.
3. **Capture correctness baselines** (DESIGN.md §4) for each model.
4. **Stand up the test harness** — CRPS/KL numerical checks, normalize↔inverse
   round-trip, tiny-model forward/backward, a `conftest`-registered `--fast`.
5. Then start the optimization ladder (torch.compile first — enable the existing
   `TORCH_COMPILE_MODE` plumbing), one gated commit each.

## In progress

- **Polaris bring-up PR open for review** — branch `polaris-pbs-bringup` pushed
  (`9cb0f3b`); open at
  https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/pedramh-profiling/pull/new/polaris-pbs-bringup
  (a solo session cannot self-approve — maintainer review/merge needed).
- **Deferred, ready:** **ERA5 Globus stage** → unblocks the S2S + S2S-Lightning smokes
  (scripts already preflight `ERA5_NOT_STAGED`).
- **makani / physicsnemo — torch_harmonics conflict RESOLVED via an isolated venv.**
  makani 0.2.0 needs the *public* `precompute_latitudes`, absent from every torch-2.8-safe
  release (0.7.4/0.8.0); 0.9.1 ships wheels only (no sdist) and its `attention/_C.so`
  ABI-breaks torch 2.8. Resolution (per user): `polaris_setup_sfno_venv.sh` builds an
  isolated `--system-site-packages` venv with **torch_harmonics 0.9.x from GitHub source**,
  so the base conda keeps 0.7.4 and the GREEN Pangu/SI smokes need no re-validation.
  **Trap:** a `--system-site-packages` venv re-enables the USER site, which `site.py` puts
  *before* the venv — the base's `--user` 0.7.4 shadowed the venv and makani still failed;
  fixed with `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` in the venv + both SFNO PBS scripts.
  Two more launch traps (both encoded in the scripts): `torchrun` resolves to the BASE
  conda launcher (whose shebang pins the base python) because the venv inherits torch and
  has no torchrun — use `python -m torch.distributed.run`; and makani's `--batch_size` is
  GLOBAL, so it must divide the rank count. Plus an **upstream makani bug** (pin
  `c970430`): `self.logger` is assigned only when `log_to_screen` is truthy (rank-0 only)
  yet `deterministic_trainer.py` calls it unconditionally → every non-zero rank died;
  patched in our `plasim_trainer.py` wrapper, not in makani.
  **RESULT: Makani pack GREEN (`CONVERT_OK`, 7252736) and Makani SFNO 4-GPU smoke GREEN
  (7252769: train loss 2.19, val 2.05, checkpoint written, rc=0).**
  PhysicsNeMo: venv ready, converter authored (+NaN fills + all-finite gate); zarr store
  and the hydra SeqZarr/transform wiring still unproven.

## Decisions / changes log

- **2026-07-14** — **Polaris (PBS) bring-up.** Confirmed cluster facts (`-A
  lighthouse-uchicago`, 4×A100-40GB sm80, `debug` queue, `filesystems=home:eagle`,
  `/local/scratch`); env = base ALCF conda (`module load conda`, torch 2.8/cu12.9) +
  `pip install --user` netCDF4/zarr/**torch_harmonics 0.7.4** (0.9.1 ABI-breaks torch 2.8).
  **Probe GREEN** (job 7251974). **PanguWeather-SFNO 4-GPU smoke GREEN** (job 7252271):
  climatology CDF-5→NETCDF4 auto-prep + 1 bounded epoch, train loss 0.3411, DDP
  validation, rc=0. Two traps recorded in `polaris_pbs_notes.md`: (1) Pangu `--debug`
  hardcodes `world_size=1` → OOMs under `torchrun -n4` (bound with `--epochs 1`
  instead); (2) Lustre needs `HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE`. Authored all
  `polaris_*.pbs` (S2S/port/SI/Pangu/makani/physicsnemo) + 3 data converters +
  repointed configs. **S2S/port blocked on an ERA5 Globus stage** (not on Polaris);
  **makani/physicsnemo blocked on login-node `pip install`** (deferred). Caches/TMPDIR
  pinned to eagle (persistent), not node-local scratch (per user). Full detail:
  `polaris_pbs_notes.md`.
- **2026-07-13** — Model policy set to **main = Opus 4.7 (xhigh effort), subagents =
  Fable 5**. Trimmed CLAUDE.md to stay <200 lines while adding: filled the real
  Midway env paths, a per-model smoke table (what to run + PASS signal), the
  launcher-shape + env-bootstrap rules, the `test.yaml` trap (rule #12), and a
  "where to look" doc map. Ran two cold Fable-5 agents to source the additions.
- **2026-07-13** — PR #4 (`polaris-pbs-handoff`) merged to `main` (`4c283f2`);
  `polaris_handoff_prompt.md` is on `main`.
- **2026-07-13** — Cold adversarial review of the docs (three Fable-5 agents); applied
  the findings (SI `bench.py --config <path>` command, DESIGN §2 launch table,
  `data_prep` NVTX name, a concrete §4 + its §4.0 prerequisites, baseline
  `.pt`-vs-`.gitignore` fix, interactive-allocation preface, `pytest --fast` hedge).
  **Also fixed a real regression:** the port smokes hardcoded a cwd-relative
  `v2.0/config/test.yaml` (pre-monorepo) → now resolved relative to `__file__`.
- **2026-07-13** — Added `DESIGN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (design spec,
  working guide, living doc) patterned on `smsharma/clax` + the MARSHAL/decrypto
  playbooks. Establishes the **numerical-equivalence-vs-baseline** gate as the oracle.
- **2026-07-13** — Published the repo; repo-wide **SNFO → SI** rename (SI is correct;
  SNFO a mislabel). NGC key scrubbed to `$NGC_API_KEY`. `main` branch-protected.

## Known issues / failed approaches (do NOT re-attempt)

Each is attributed to its source doc — verify there before acting.

- **(Polaris) `torch_harmonics` version box** — makani 0.2.0 imports the *public*
  `torch_harmonics.quadrature.precompute_latitudes`, which does NOT exist in 0.7.4 or
  0.8.0 (private `_precompute_latitudes`). 0.9.1 has it but ships **wheels only** (no
  sdist on PyPI — `--no-binary :all:` cannot build it) and its prebuilt
  `attention/_C.so` fails on torch 2.8 with `undefined symbol:
  _ZNK3c1010TensorImpl15incref_pyobjectEv`, so `import torch_harmonics` dies outright.
  Don't re-try pinning a PyPI version — install from the GitHub source (compiles `_C`
  against the local torch) **and re-verify the green Pangu-SFNO smoke**, or isolate the
  SFNO frameworks in their own venv. — `polaris_pbs_notes.md` §6.
- **(Polaris) Pangu `--debug` is single-GPU ONLY** — it hardcodes `world_size=1`, so
  under `torchrun --nproc_per_node=4` all 4 ranks init as rank-0-on-GPU-0 and OOM the
  40 GB A100. Bound a smoke with `--epochs 1` instead. — `polaris_pbs_notes.md` §5.
- **(Polaris) SI `calendar: 'noleap'` crashes the loader** — noleap is an *idealized*
  cftime calendar that forces `has_year_zero=True`, clashing with `has_year_zero: False`
  at `si/data/amip_new.py:667` (`cannot compute the time difference between dates with
  year zero conventions`). Use `'standard'` (correct for a non-leap-year smoke); a full
  run crossing a leap year needs a loader fix. — `polaris_pbs_notes.md` §8.
- **Port standalone smokes had a stale cwd-relative config path** (`v2.0/config/test.yaml`,
  pre-monorepo) → `FileNotFoundError` before any GPU work. Fixed 2026-07-13 (resolve
  relative to `__file__`). If a port smoke can't find the config, check this first.
- **"Missing kernel tables" are NOT a profiler/ptrace limit** — an unconditional
  `restore_checkpoint()` crashed on `FileNotFoundError` before any GPU work (a
  byte-identical CUDA-API fingerprint). Fixed with the `os.path.isfile` guard. If a
  profile has no kernel table, **read the `.err` first.** — `bench_report.md` §II.7.
- **S2S batch ≥3/card (bf16) is a trap** — throughput collapses near allocator
  saturation and 4/card OOMs; the known-good ceiling on ~94 GB cards is **2/card**.
  — `bench_report.md` §II.4.
- **`num_data_workers=0` fakes a GPU-idle "bottleneck"** (large idle %; SI's first
  4-GPU bench failed its sanity check on HDF5 reads). Known-good: 8 workers +
  `--cpus-per-task=8`. — `bench_report.md` §II.7 / `si/bench_midway_notes.md`.
- **Inference: always pass `--async_save`** — synchronous NetCDF saving throttles
  rank 0 well below the other ranks. — `bench_report.md` §II.7.
- **Don't remove SI's fp32 island around the spherical-harmonic transform** — bf16
  breaks `torch_harmonics` (`view_as_complex` rejects bf16); it's wrapped in
  `autocast(enabled=False)` on purpose, cost ≈ 0. — `si/bench_midway_notes.md` §3–4.
- **SI + `torch.compile max-autotune` / nsys-on-compiled-SI** — reported to
  crash/segfault (CUDA-graph capture; tracing the compiled DDP backward). Use
  `default` compile mode; profile eager, bench compiled. — `si/bench_optim_sweep.sh`
  header (verify before relying on it).
- **DSI handoff-latency investigation** — several hypotheses already investigated;
  the current lead is a **driver/CUDA mismatch** (not interconnect). Read
  `bench_report.md` §I.5/§I.7 and don't re-run the ruled-out ones.

## Open questions (answer + record here)

- **Baseline node class.** The SI optimization-sweep CSVs (`si/bench_optim_*.csv`)
  ran on the **test partition H100**, a different node class from the pedramh-gpu
  H100-NVL numbers — re-measure a pedramh-gpu baseline to compare like-for-like.
- **A100 (Polaris) memory** — the "40 GB" figure is from prose, not an on-node
  `nvidia-smi` (`si/bench_midway_notes.md` fn2); confirm during Polaris bring-up.
- **SI compile gain** — reported ~+62% (`default` mode) but a `*_postfix` re-run is
  lower; quote it as a range until re-measured on pedramh-gpu.

## Benchmark results

**Read the existing evidence before capturing baselines or claiming a speedup**
(compare only within a cluster, never A100 vs H100 NVL):
- `s2s/v2.0/bench_report.md` — S2S H100-NVL baselines + the step-time / VAE-encoder split.
- `si/bench_midway_notes.md` — SI bench + decisions log (refutes the "H200" label).
- `si/bench_optim_*.csv` + `si/bench_optim_sweep.sh` header — the 2026-05 one-lever-
  at-a-time SI optimization sweep (test-partition H100 — a different node class).
- `s2s-lightning/LIGHTNING_PORT.md` — the port's DDP/AMP/bench wiring + per-phase
  smoke-id table. **The port-vs-v2.0 nsys caveat** is in the header of
  `s2s-lightning/midway_bench_nsys_port.sh`: the port's per-step NVTX window opens at
  `on_train_batch_start` (after H2D), so its `step_med` excludes the transfer —
  compare throughput via `samples_per_s_wall`, never `step_med`.
- `s2s/v2.0/HPC_scripts/bench_methodology.md` — what every `bench_results.csv` column
  means and why timing is `cuda.synchronize`-bracketed.

**Hardware identity (do not reintroduce refuted labels):** `pedramh-gpu` is
**H100 NVL (~93 GB)**, NOT "H200" (a commit message said so; refuted in
`si/bench_midway_notes.md`) and NOT "80 GB H100". NVLink is within socket-pairs only
(GPU0↔1, GPU2↔3); the host is PCIe Gen4. The Midway H200 *test* partition is a
separate node class (full-mesh NVLink, PCIe Gen5).

**How to capture a baseline (BLOCKED on §4.0):** procedure = DESIGN.md §4.1, storage
= §4.2 (JSON/CSV summary in git, tensors on cluster storage), metric definitions =
`bench_methodology.md`. Record each capture as a dated row here.
